# ROCm Python Packaging via TheRock

Given ROCm artifacts directories, performs surgery to re-layout them for
distribution as Python packages and builds sdists and wheels as appropriate.

This process involves both a re-organization of the sources and some surgical
alterations.

## General Design

We generate the following types of packages:

- Selector package: The `rocm` package is built as an sdist so that it is
  evaluated at the point of install, allowing it to perform some selection logic
  to detect dependencies and needs. Most other packages are installed by
  asking to install extras of this one (i.e.
  `rocm[libraries,device-gfx942]`, etc).
  - The `rocm` package provides the `rocm-sdk` tool.
  - The `rocm` package uses the `import rocm_sdk` Python namespace as we do
    not want a barename `rocm`.
- Runtime packages: Most packages are runtime packages. These are wheel files
  that are ready to be expanded directly into a site-lib directory. They contain
  only the minimal set of files needed to run. Critically, they do not contain
  symlinks (instead, only SONAME libraries are included, and any executable
  symlinks are emitted by dynamically compiling an executable that can execle
  a relative binary).
- Device packages: Per-ISA device wheels (`rocm-sdk-device-{target}`) are
  produced alongside an arch-neutral `rocm-sdk-libraries` host wheel. Device
  wheels contain `.kpack` archives and kernel databases (Tensile `.co`/`.dat`,
  MIOpen `.kdb`/`.db.txt`, etc.) that overlay into the `rocm-sdk-libraries`
  platform directory in site-packages. Each device wheel declares
  `Requires-Dist` on the matching version of `rocm-sdk-libraries`. Users install
  only the device wheels for their GPU target(s).
- Devel package: The `rocm-sdk-devel` package is the catch-all for everything.
  For any file already populated in a runtime package, it will include it as
  a relative symlink in the tarball. During extraction, file symlinks are
  converted to hardlinks to improve compatibility, while directory symlinks
  remain as symlinks. Shared library soname links are also rewritten as needed.
  Since symlinks/hardlinks and non-standard attributes cannot be included in a
  wheel file, the platform contents are stored in a `_devel.tar` or `_devel.tar.xz`
  file. The installed package is extended in response to requesting a path to it
  via the `rocm-sdk` tool.

### Kpack-split packaging

All current builds enable `KPACK_SPLIT_ARTIFACTS` by default. The
`rocm-sdk-libraries` host wheel is architecture neutral and device code is
distributed in `rocm-sdk-device-{target}` wheels, one per GFX ISA target. The
devel package is also architecture neutral and excludes test binaries, which
require device code to run. The packaging tools detect this layout from the
flag in the build's `therock_manifest.json`. Support for older manifests is
retained temporarily in the implementation but is not part of the current
release flow; see [issue 3340](https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock/issues/3340).

The arch-neutral `rocm-sdk-devel` tree does not itself contain per-ISA device
files. Each installed `rocm-sdk-device-{target}` wheel ships a manifest, and
`rocm-sdk init` - which also runs on the first use of a devel tool such as
`hipcc` - hardlinks that wheel's device files from `rocm-sdk-libraries` into the
devel tree, recording them in the device wheel's `RECORD` so `pip uninstall`
removes them. Because the compiler trampolines only trigger this on the first
expansion, after installing or removing a `rocm-sdk-device-*` wheel in an
already-initialized environment, re-run `rocm-sdk init` or `rocm-sdk test` to
refresh the device files in the devel tree.

It is expected that all packages are installed in the same site-lib, as they use
relative symlinks and RPATHs that cross the top-level package boundary. The
built-in tests (via `rocm-sdk test`) verify these conditions.

## Building Packages

ROCm Python packages are built using the
[`build_tools/build_python_packages.py`](/build_tools/build_python_packages.py)
script.

### Build Package Versions

By default, development packages have versions like `7.10.0.dev0` (possibly
including a commit hash). You can also set an explicit fixed version with the
`--version` argument to `build_python_packages.py`. See
[`build_tools/compute_rocm_package_version.py`](/build_tools/compute_rocm_package_version.py).
and the [versioning documentation](versioning.md) for more version formats.

### Package Target Selection

The GPU target selected by the `rocm` meta package is determined in the following
order:

1. `ROCM_SDK_TARGET_FAMILY` environment variable, if set.
1. Dynamically discovered target family on the system.
1. The fallback default defined in `dist_info.DEFAULT_TARGET_FAMILY`.

For CI builds on CPU-only machines, this will typically fall through to (3).
For developer machines with GPUs, the dynamic detection in (2) should suffice,
but can be overridden by setting (1).

If multiple GPU architectures are present, dynamic detection defaults to the
first available target. Set the `ROCM_SDK_TARGET_FAMILY` environment variable to
override that choice. The environment variable retains its historical name but
accepts an individual GFX ISA target such as `gfx942`.

### Building from Local Artifacts

If you have a local build with artifacts:

```bash
./build_tools/build_python_packages.py \
    --artifact-dir ./output-linux-portable/build/artifacts \
    --dest-dir ${HOME}/tmp/packages
```

Note that this does do some dynamic compilation of files and it performs
patching via patchelf. On Linux, it is recommended to run this in the same
portable container as was used to build the SDK (so as to avoid the possibility
of accidentally referencing too-new glibc symbols).

If running on a host rather than the portable container, make sure the host
`patchelf` carries the [PR #544](https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf/pull/544)
PHDR-relocation fix. A stock distro `patchelf`
(for example Ubuntu's `apt install patchelf`) will silently corrupt the
kpack-split libraries produced by TheRock, yielding wheels whose shared
objects fail to load at install time. See
[environment_setup_guide.md#patchelf](../environment_setup_guide.md#patchelf)
for supported install paths.

### Building from CI Artifacts

You can also build packages from artifacts uploaded by CI workflows:

```bash
# 1. Fetch artifacts from a CI run (find run IDs at github.com/ROCm/TheRock/actions)
RUN_ID="<replace-with-run-id>"
ARTIFACTS_DIR=${HOME}/therock/${RUN_ID}/artifacts
PACKAGES_DIR=${HOME}/therock/${RUN_ID}/packages

# Fetch the complete platform artifact set. Package construction requires the
# generic host artifacts and every device target recorded in the build manifest.
python ./build_tools/fetch_artifacts.py \
    --run-id=${RUN_ID} \
    --output-dir=${ARTIFACTS_DIR}

# 2. Build Python packages from the fetched artifacts
python ./build_tools/build_python_packages.py \
    --artifact-dir=${ARTIFACTS_DIR} \
    --dest-dir=${PACKAGES_DIR}

# 3. Check the packages that were built
ls ${PACKAGES_DIR}/dist
# rocm_sdk_core-*.whl
# rocm_sdk_libraries-*.whl
# rocm_sdk_device_gfx942-*.whl, rocm_sdk_device_gfx1100-*.whl, ...
# rocm_sdk_devel-*.whl
# rocm-*.tar.gz
```

### Installing Locally Built Packages

To install locally built packages, you can use the
[`-f, --find-links`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#cmdoption-f)
option. Replace `device-gfx942` with the target for your GPU, or use
`device-all` to install every device wheel:

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install "rocm[libraries,devel,device-gfx942]" --pre \
    --find-links=${PACKAGES_DIR}/dist

# Run sanity tests to verify the installation
rocm-sdk test
```

You can also create an index.html page with the
[`indexer.py` script](/third-party/indexer/indexer.py):

```bash
# Generate index.html in the dist directory
python ./third-party/indexer/indexer.py ${PACKAGES_DIR}/dist \
    --filter "*.whl" "*.tar.gz"

# Install using --find-links
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install "rocm[libraries,devel,device-gfx942]" --pre \
    --find-links=${PACKAGES_DIR}/dist/index.html
```

> [!TIP]
> For CI-style testing with the same directory layout used by workflows, use
> [`build_tools/github_actions/upload_python_packages.py`](/build_tools/github_actions/upload_python_packages.py)
> with `--output-dir` instead of directly calling the indexer. This generates
> the index and organizes files into the `{run_id}-{platform}/python/{artifact_group}/`
> structure used by CI uploads.

## Mirroring Third-Party Python Dependencies

[`mirror_python_dependencies.py`](/build_tools/packaging/python/mirror_python_dependencies.py)
resolves configured third-party wheels from PyPI and publishes them to the
structured core `whl-next` prefix. It is usable from CI or locally.

Resolve and download an immutable snapshot without AWS access:

```bash
python build_tools/packaging/python/mirror_python_dependencies.py resolve \
  --output-dir /tmp/rocm-dependency-snapshot
```

After configuring normal boto3/AWS credentials with `HeadObject`, `GetObject`,
`PutObject`, and same-key `CopyObject` access to one destination bucket,
publish the same local snapshot:

```bash
python build_tools/packaging/python/mirror_python_dependencies.py publish \
  --snapshot-dir /tmp/rocm-dependency-snapshot \
  --bucket therock-repo-amd-dev-core \
  --refresh-existing
```

Use `mirror` for a convenient one-bucket resolve and publish. Add `--dry-run`
to `publish` or `mirror` to inspect the required S3 operations without writing.
Existing objects are skipped by default. `--refresh-existing` performs a
conditional same-key copy, which updates `LastModified` so retained-stream
lifecycle rules do not expire the current dependency version. Older versions
are not refreshed. Run
`python build_tools/packaging/python/mirror_python_dependencies.py --help` and
the subcommand help for project and individual dependency selection.

The tool publishes to the core product-local index under
`v5/rocm/core/whl-next/`; see the
[nightly core index](https://nightly.repo.amd.com/rocm/core/whl-next/) for a
user-visible example. The aggregate `/rocm/whl-next/` index does not duplicate
these wheels. Instead,
[`rocm_whl_next_ownership.yaml`](/build_tools/packaging/python/rocm_whl_next_ownership.yaml)
separately controls which product-local package page the aggregate index routes
to. Publishing only to the product-local path is sufficient to populate the
core index without implicitly changing that routing. If a mirrored dependency
should also be available through the aggregate index used by pip, add its core
ownership mapping and redeploy the aggregate index.

The `Mirror Python Dependencies` workflow will live with the other
[rockrel workflows](https://github.com/ROCm/rockrel/tree/main/.github/workflows).
It will resolve one snapshot every Monday and sequentially publish it to `dev`,
`nightly`, `rc`, and `stable-staging`. Manual dispatch will default to
resolve-only and allow targeting one stream for diagnostics. Retained streams
will refresh only the current snapshot's existing objects; stable-staging will
skip existing objects because it has no lifecycle expiration. If a stream
fails, rerun the complete workflow. Each run is idempotent, and older versions
remain subject to their normal retention policy.

## rocm-profiler

The `rocm-profiler` package provides ROCm profiling tools and runtime components. It contains:

- ROCm Systems Profiler (rocprofiler-systems)
- ROCm Compute Profiler (rocprofiler-compute)

### Installation

#### Using meta package

The recommended way to install profiling tools is via the meta package:

```bash
pip install "rocm[profiler]"
```

This will install:

- `rocm-sdk-core` (required runtime + SDK)
- `rocm-profiler` (profiling tools)

#### Direct installation

Direct installation is not recommended for typical use:

```bash
pip install rocm-profiler
```

This may result in missing dependencies unless `rocm-sdk-core` is also installed.

Always prefer:

```bash
pip install "rocm[profiler]"
```

### Package Layout

ROCm Python packaging separates profiling functionality as follows:

- `rocm-sdk-core`:

  - `rocprofiler-sdk` libraries
  - `rocprofv3`, `rocprof-attach`
  - `roctx` API (user-facing annotation library)

- `rocm-profiler`:

  - `rocprof-compute`
  - `rocprof-sys-*`
  - profiler runtime libraries (from `rocprofiler-systems` and `rocprofiler-compute`)

This separation allows you to install profiling tools only when needed.

### Dependency Model

The `rocm-profiler` package intentionally does **not** declare `install_requires`.

Instead:

- Dependencies are managed by the `rocm` meta package.
- Packages are co-installed into the same `site-packages`.
- Runtime dependencies are resolved using RPATH.

> [!NOTE]
> The `rocm` meta package requires a device wheel for the selected GFX ISA target
> (for example, `rocm-sdk-device-gfx942`). If it is not available in the selected
> package index, installation may be incomplete.

## Using Packages from Frameworks

### Building Python Based Projects

Generally, Python based framework users will build against installed ROCm
Python development packages. For frameworks that only depend on the core ROCm
subset (including runtime, HIP, system libraries and critical path math
libraries), this is a process of installing the development packages like:

```bash
# See RELEASES.md for exact target-specific incantations, --index-url
# combinations, etc.
pip install "rocm[libraries,devel,device-gfx942]"
```

Then build your framework by setting appropriate CMake settings or environment
variables. Examples (exact settings needed will vary by project being built):

```bash
-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$(rocm-sdk path --cmake)
-DROCM_HOME=$(rocm-sdk path --root)
export PATH="$(rocm-sdk path --bin):$PATH"
```

### Configuring your Python Project Dependencies

This is typically sufficient to *build* ROCm based Python projects. However,
because built projects will typically do dynamic linking to ROCm host libraries
and this will be done on arbitrary systems, it is also necessary to change the
project's packaging and initialization.

Taking PyTorch as an example, you want to inject an install requirement on
the ROCm python packages for a specific version (all projects will have their
own way to do this):

```bash
export PYTORCH_EXTRA_INSTALL_REQUIREMENTS="rocm[libraries]=={$(rocm-sdk version)}"
```

### Performing Initialization

Typical ROCm dependent Python projects will have an `__init__.py` which precedes
using any extensions or native libraries which depend on ROCm. Ultimately,
this initializer will need to call `rocm_sdk.initialize_process()` to initialize
needed libraries. We recommend the following common idiom for managing this:

When building from ROCm wheels, add a `_rocm_init.py` to the root of the
project such that it is included in built wheels. Then in your `__init__.py`
add code like this:

```python
try:
    from . import _rocm_init
except ModuleNotFoundError:
    pass
else:
    _rocm_init.initialize()
    del _rocm_init
```

Generate a `_rocm_init.py` file like this (using any suitable scripting):

```bash
echo "
def initialize():
  import rocm_sdk
  rocm_sdk.initialize_process(preload_shortnames=[
    'amd_comgr',
    'amdhip64',
    'roctx64',
    'hiprtc',
    'hipblas',
    'hipfft',
    'hiprand',
    'hipsparse',
    'hipsparselt',
    'hipsolver',
    'rccl',
    'hipblaslt',
    'miopen',
    'hipdnn',
  ],
  check_version='$(rocm-sdk version)')
" > torch/_rocm_init.py
```

Note that you must preload any libraries that your native extensions depend on
so that when the operating system attempts to resolve linkage, they are already
in the namespace. The above is an example that, at the time of writing, was
suitable for PyTorch. Note that it version locks to a specific ROCm SDK version.
This is generally appropriate for development/nightly builds. For production
builds, you will want to lock to a major/minor version only and use a wildcard
(\*) to match the suffix.

By default, on version mismatch, a Warning will be raised. You can pass
`fail_on_version_mismatch=True` to make this an exception.

### Dynamic Library Resolution

The above procedure works for libraries that are hard dependencies of native
extensions or their deps. If code needs to dynamically load libraries, typically
preloading them in this way will work, and then a subsequent `dlopen()` or
equiv will find them. However, the `rocm_sdk.find_libraries(*shortnames)`
entrypoint is also provided and can be used to query an OS independent
absolute path to a given named library that is known to the distribution.

### Testing

The `rocm` distribution, if installed, bundles self tests which verify
API contracts and file/directory layout. Since the Python ecosystem is ever
evolving, and packages like this use several "adventurous" features, we
bundle the ability for detailed self checks. Run them with:

```bash
rocm-sdk test
```

If you are having any problem with your ROCm Python installation, it is
recommended to run this to verify integrity and basic functionality.

Providing the output of `rocm-sdk test` in any bug reports is greatly
appreciated.
